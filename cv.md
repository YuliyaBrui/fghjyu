## **ABOUT ME**</br>
I have been working as a chemical engineer since 2013. Having reached a leading position, I do not see any prospects for growth and development further in the industry. The same cannot be said about the IT sphere. Abilities such as attention to detail, dedication, perseverance allowed me to learn CSS and HTML on my own. Now I am learning the basics of JS and improving my knowledge at RS School.
